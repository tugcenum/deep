 Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have impressive performance on areas that have big datasets . The pointed problem in the paper  is that for facial expression recognition, there are small datasets and even with some methods tried before ( Dropout and Batch Normalizing) results are not satisfactory. In the previous works,  fine-tuning method  partially solved the issue but still below the acceptable levels. In the paper,they propose FaceNet2ExpNet method to solve the problem and they claim that they got better results than state-of-the-art.  They evaluated the method on 4 public datasets and presented.
